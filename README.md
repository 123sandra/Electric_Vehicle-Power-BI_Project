# Electric_Vehicle-Power-BI_Project
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the growth,graphics, and trends in the electric vehicle (EV) population  By visualizing the adoption and distribution of EVs across regions, manufacturers, and vehicle types, this dashboard aims to offer insights into the evolving landscape of sustainable transportation. The data includes various dimensions like model year, geographic distribution, vehicle type, manufacturer, and EV growth over time.
I have done DAX calculations for generating Average age of the EV vehicle, fastest acceleration of the vehicle, Top speed etc..
